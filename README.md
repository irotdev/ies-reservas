# ies-reservas
**Reservation APP** for laptops, tables, lounges, etc. in **PHP**, for the study center where I am working as a computer teacher. <br>
**It is not finished**, there are many things to do, and it is an example **to improve with the students**.
<br><br>
### **Updated plan**
I am going to change this project:
- The structured is OK, but I want to improve it using a current framework as Laravel and using PHP 8.2.
- Also, I am going to define more hours to reserve (maybe until 20 time slots, maybe infinite per day, I don't know).
- About the days, the calendar will be defined by the admin, including Saturday and Sunday every week (the admin user will select the days previously, even the bank holidays).
- The admin user will select the rooms, books, tablets, computers, etc. which he will select.
- Some things, as tablets and computers could be selected as a group (for example, a specific group of tablets which in the room "tablet room").ยก
- And well... I will thing about the structure of that and create an API in order to do request for websites, mobile phones, and desktop programs.
